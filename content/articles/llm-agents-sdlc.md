The first wave of AI in software was autocomplete on steroids. You typed, the model suggested, you accepted or rejected. Useful, incremental, and fundamentally still *you* doing the work.

The second wave is different in kind. An agent does not wait for you to type. You hand it an issue — "the cart total is wrong when a promo code is removed" — and it plans an approach, edits the relevant files, runs the tests, and opens a pull request. You review the result, not the keystrokes.

This is not a faster horse. It changes what each stage of the software delivery lifecycle is *for*.

## From writing code to specifying intent

When an agent can implement a well-scoped issue, the scarce skill shifts upstream. The bottleneck is no longer typing the solution; it is *describing the problem precisely enough that the solution is verifiable*.

> The new senior engineer is not the fastest typist. It is the person who can decompose ambiguous work into crisp, checkable units.

A vague issue produces a vague pull request. A sharp issue — clear acceptance criteria, a reproduction case, explicit constraints — produces a reviewable change. Issue hygiene, long treated as project-management overhead, becomes a core engineering skill.

## The lifecycle, re-examined

Walk through the SDLC and ask what an agent changes at each stage:

1. **Plan.** Agents can draft implementation plans from an issue, surfacing the files they intend to touch and the risks they foresee. Humans approve the plan before a line is written.
2. **Build.** The agent implements against the plan. This is the stage people focus on, but it is arguably the least interesting — implementation was never the hard part.
3. **Review.** This is where the weight moves. When code is cheap to produce, review becomes the primary quality gate. Reviewing AI-authored code is a discipline of its own.
4. **Ship.** Deployment automation matters more, not less. If agents open ten pull requests a day, your delivery pipeline must be trustworthy enough to handle the volume.

## Reviewing what the machine wrote

Reviewing agent output is not the same as reviewing a colleague's. The failure modes differ:

- **Confident wrongness.** An agent rarely says "I'm not sure." It produces plausible code with the same tone whether it is right or catastrophically off.
- **Local correctness, global blindness.** The change may be perfect in isolation and violate an architectural convention the agent never saw.
- **Test theater.** An agent can write tests that pass by asserting the buggy behavior. Green checks are necessary, not sufficient.

The practical defense is the same one that has always worked: **a running environment.** Read the agent's plan, then use the result. Confident wrongness collapses the moment you exercise the actual behavior.

## What this means for teams

Three shifts are worth planning for now:

- **Invest in the review surface.** Preview environments, good test coverage, and clear architectural guardrails are what let you accept agent work safely and quickly.
- **Treat issues as specifications.** The quality of agent output is bounded by the quality of the problem statement.
- **Keep humans on the irreversible decisions.** Let agents propose; keep people accountable for what merges and what ships.

## The bottom line

LLM agents do not remove humans from software delivery. They relocate us — out of the editor and into the roles of specifier and reviewer. The teams that thrive will not be the ones with the most AI. They will be the ones whose lifecycle was already disciplined enough that an agent's work can be trusted, checked, and shipped without fear.
